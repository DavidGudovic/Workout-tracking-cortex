## Usage

These files are designed for AI agents to quickly reference specific information without loading large documents. Each file is focused on a single topic or context.

## Backend-Only Scope

**IMPORTANT**: This is a backend API project only. All files focus on:
- JSON API design
- Business logic
- Data layer
- Authentication/Authorization

NO frontend, views, or client-side code.
